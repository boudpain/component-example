This is the example used for an article I wrote: [Build a Web app with component(1)](http://blog.kewah.com/2014/build-a-web-app-with-component/).

*Personal SCSS naming convention: files prefixed with an underscore should not be `@import`ed in another component.*

## Start the demo

```
$ make demo
```
